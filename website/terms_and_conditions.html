            <p class='terms-body main-font'>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
                the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies
                with whom it is being shared. – See more at: <a href='https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf'>California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</a></p>

            <p class='terms-body main-font'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection

            <p class='terms-body main-font'>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br> In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
                responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email:</p>

            <p class='terms-body main-font'>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
                individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute noncompliance by data processors.</p>
