Red Bison Technology Group LLC, located at 10200 NE 10th Street, Bellevue WA 98004, United States (“Red Bison,” “we,” or “us”).<br/><br/>
                These Terms of Use, along with any agreements, terms, conditions, or policies referenced herein or made available to you hereafter set forth the legal binding terms of your use of the Services and the use of the Services by any other person on whose behalf you are subscribing to the Services or for whom you are subscribing to the Services. By establishing an administrative account (an “Account”), by signing-in to your Account, by logging on the Red Bison Wi-Fi network through the Captive Portal or other means, or otherwise using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and your organization and you represent that you are capable of entering into a legally binding agreement. You agree that you are responsible for all activity on the Services, whether such activity is undertaken by you or by a third party you provide access to our Services. You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to respect and abide by all rules promulgated by Red Bison from time to time.<br/><br/>
                If you are an individual procuring the Services on behalf of an organization or company (“organization”), you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority to bind your organization to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, otherwise you are required to refrain from using the Services on behalf of your organization. Further, you warrant that all of your organization’s personnel and anyone using the Services by means of credentials generated through your Account (as defined herein) will abide by the terms set forth in this Agreement.<br/><br/>
                From time to time, we may offer you optional additional features or services (“Additional Services”) that may be subject to additional or different terms of use (“Additional Terms”). Examples of Additional Services include unified communications, VOIP and other managed services. All such Additional Services form part of the Services and you may not use such Additional Services unless you agree to the Additional Terms. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. Some of these Additional Services may be offered by third parties with which Red Bison has a reseller
                relationship or other form of commercial arrangement (“Third Party Providers”).

                You agree that Red Bison may change these Terms of Use, or its other rules associated with the use of the Services at any time by giving you advance notice or by publishing on its website and any changes are effective immediately upon publication or delivery. Continuing use of the Services after changes to these Terms of Use means that you agree to the changes.<br/><br/>

                THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR YOUR ACCOUNT TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEEDING IN COURT. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU MUST REFRAIN FROM USING THE SERVICES OR YOUR ACCOUNT.

                <span class='ol-title'>Fees and Charges</span>
                <p class='terms-body main-font'>Pricing is based on a pay-per-user model. Information about Red Bison fees and rates can be found on the <a class="font-weight-bold" href="https://www.redbison.com">Red Bison website</a>. You may buy more users or decrease the number of users in your Service Plan. We do not refund the difference for the month in which you decrease the number of users in your Service Plan.<br/>
                The Services will be billed by Red Bison on a monthly basis at the beginning of each calendar month for the Services purchased for the previous month. Payment for the monthly recurring fee is due within the first 10 days of the month. We will bill one-time charges in the next monthly payment or in a later billing cycle following your authorization of such charges. Taxes and surcharges will vary depending on the Services and your location. You agree to pay all applicable taxes, surcharges, and other fees. Examples of surcharges include, but are not limited to, Federal and State Universal Service fees, and regulatory and administrative fees.<br/><br/>
                For each month, all fees and charges should be paid by the payment due date. By storing the account and credit card information with our secure Payment Gateway Provider, you authorize Red Bison to charge your default credit card or debit your checking or savings account through automated clearing house (ACH). By opting in for auto-pay recurring payments, you authorize Red Bison to charge all recurring fees from your specified credit card or from the checking or savings account you specify through ACH debit entry. You agree to be bound by any rules your financial institution applies for pre-authorized credit card and ACH transactions. You are responsible for all fees charged by your financial institution for these transactions.<br/><br/>
                The charges will appear on the bill as Red Bison. If Red Bison does not receive the full payment by the payment due date and is unable to withdraw the funds from your credit card or ACH account, you will be subject to late fees and any fees and charges from your financial institution.<br/><br/>
                Red Bison reserves the right to temporarily or permanently suspend the Services if a customer does not pay his/her/its bill. Red Bison will not re-establish the Services until it receives all due payments and charges. If you believe you were incorrectly charged by us, you must dispute those charges in an email to us within ninety (90) days of the date we charge your account. You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period.<br/><br/>
                Red Bison is not liable for any losses you may incur because of a payment made on incorrectly billed items, incorrect statement or invoice, or for any delay in charging your card or checking or saving account.<br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bolder">TLDR:</span>  Pricing for our Services depends on the number of users on your Account. You will be billed monthly and pay at the beginning of each calendar month for the
                Services purchased for the previous month. If you have a balance due on your Account, you may be subject to additional charges, or your Account may be suspended. If you opt into autopay or save your billing information, that information may be used to process your payments.

                <span class='ol-title'>Term and Termination</span>
                <p class='terms-body main-font'>You may terminate the Services for Wi-Fi only at any time after thirty (30) days of receiving the Services. To terminate the Services, you or your Account administrator must inform Red Bison 30 days before termination of the Wi-Fi service.<br/><br/>
                Red Bison will not prorate or refund any portion of the fees paid for Services in the event you terminate the Services during a month in which the Services have already been invoiced or paid.<br/><br/>
                Further, you agree to pay the balance of any outstanding charges including any additional invoices after cancellation for charges you incurred while your account was active.<br/><br/>
                Red Bison reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account and the Services in the event of non-payment or late-payment and you agree that Red Bison may terminate your Account at any time after emailing you a notice.<br/><br/>
                Red Bison reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account and the Services in the case of suspected fraud, un-ethical behavior, or non-compliance with this Agreement.<br/>
                Red Bison may terminate this Agreement and the Services for any reason with thirty (30) days’ notice to you for any reason. Such notice of termination from Red Bison (a “Red Bison Termination Notice”) may be delivered to you by any means deemed appropriate by Red Bison, including by email to the email address associated with your account.<br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bolder">TLDR:</span>  You can cancel our Wi-Fi Services at any time after the first month and fees are not refundable. We may also stop providing you the Services with a thirty days’ notice.

                    Red Bison aims to provide reliable, quality services to our users according to industry standards and aims to protect our users, network and Services from harm. Given the limited bandwidth available at any time, Red Bison manages its network to ensure the best performance for the most users. For example, because of bandwidth limitations, the use of certain services or products available on the Internet may be prioritized. Further, Red Bison may manage an individual application that uses excessive data for short intervals of time to improve the user experience. A particular application exceeding a certain data transfer rate per hour may have its rate limited. Streams that are likely to trigger rate management include streaming video, cloud uploads, file syncing, and large email downloads. Streams that are unlikely to trigger rate management include internet browsing and standard email access.<br/><br/>
                    Additionally, Red Bison may analyze network traffic to detect and prevent spam, malware, viruses and phishing distribution. We may suspend Services in case of activities which are unlawful, fraudulent or which do not adhere with our Acceptable Use Policy. Our suppliers may also apply their own network management policies to protect their services. You may only access the Services with devices that do not harm the Services or our network and comply with Federal Communications Commission regulations. If we suspect malware on your private network, we will notify you of the potential security threat. We may also suspend your device from using some or all of the Services. If you believe suspension of your services was done in error, we will work with you to restore Services.<br/><br/>
                    The performance of our network is affected by your device and hardware. You and each user covered by your Account can connect a maximum of three (3) devices simultaneously to the Red Bison Wi-Fi network. Modifying or customizing your operating system could impact the performance or availability of the Services.
                    We do not allow stolen devices to use the Services and reserve the right to deny Service for stolen devices. We may ask you to install software on your device to provision our Services. There may be automatic software updates as we support new features.<br/><br/>
                    We provide security to our network. However, Red Bison cannot and does not guarantee the complete privacy of your communications. You are responsible for ensuring that your data is not accessed by unauthorized third-parties by safeguarding your devices when running third-party applications and services. Red Bison is not responsible for any information on your device, including sensitive or personal information nor is it responsible for any third-party applications.<br/><br/>

            <p class='ol-title'>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</p>
            <p class='terms-body main-font'>
                It is Red Bison’s goal to ensure that the Services meet your expectations. However, there may be instances when you have a problem or dispute that needs special attention. In those instances, Red Bison is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with Red Bison, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give Red Bison an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes you first sending a written description of your problem or dispute using the following email address: info@redbison.us or mailing address: 10200 NE 10th Street, Bellevue, WA 98004.<br/><br/>
                You then agree to negotiate with Red Bison in good faith about your problem or dispute. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within ninety (90) days after Red Bison’s receipt of your written description of it, you agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.<br/><br/>
                You agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of the Services or this Agreement, shall be final and binding arbitration, except to the extent that you have in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate Red Bison’s or any third party patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, in which case you acknowledge that arbitration is not an adequate remedy at law and that injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought by Red Bison and/or the applicable third-party(ies). You and we acknowledge that the Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under the Agreement (despite any other choice of law provision).<br/><br/>
                Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). For claims of less than $75,000 USD, the AAA’s
                Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000 USD, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org. Upon your filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000 USD. For claims that total more than $75,000 USD, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. You and we agree to pay our own other fees, costs, and expenses, including those for any attorneys, experts, and witnesses. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 USD as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith with Red Bison as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, Red Bison agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law. As a limited exception to the agreement to arbitrate, you and we agree that you may take claims to small claims court, if your claims qualify for hearing by such court.<br/><br/>
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OR CUSTOMER OF RED BISON OR ANY OTHER PARTY WITH A CLAIM AGAINST RED BISON FROM OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.<br/><br/>

                In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Services or this Agreement, be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.<br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bolder">TLDR:</span> Red Bison would like to amicably resolve any disputes that may arise. In the event that we are unable to do so, the sole and exclusive forum and remedy will be binding arbitration.
